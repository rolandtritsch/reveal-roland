** Strength ...
*** Sees innovation as a necessity (being different/unique is good)
*** Boundless energy. Multi-purpose weapon
*** A natural go-getter with a great enthusiasm for life 
** Weaknesses ...
*** Leaps before he looks (tendency to see things more positive then they are)
*** Overly dismissive of negative feedback
*** Doesn't always take time to hear others views
** Possible Blindspots ...
*** He is seen to perform better when he reins in his boldness, energy and enjoyment of being in control to a level where other people take priority. He is a born entrepreneur who is constantly overselling his next great idea and attempting to generate support for it. He may rely on personal forcefulness and, if necessary, intimidation to achieve his aims.
*** As he values creativity and innovation, he sometimes ignores the standard way of doing something because it lacks originality
** Ideal Environment ...
*** He continuously contributes to organisational improvement (building/developing people)
*** Activities, variety and change are constantly taking place
*** He can turn a vision (a big idea) into reality

   Leadership comes down to believing so strongly in the future you want that your enthusiasm, confidence, and drive in getting there infects those around you and the reality of today transforms into that vision of tomorrow through shared work and sacrifice.
